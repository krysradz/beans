              <p>Given their popularity the world over, the Seeds, nee Beans, are eager to be recognized in their proper classification, as Seeds. Neither Mr. Planta Seed nor Ms. Java Seed had a hard coating or a stem growing up but rather, during their upbringing on Coffea arabica, they had a fleshy fruit skin, similar to a cherry. Mr. Planta Seed has found fulfillment in being a bean counter, having obtained a Masters of Accounting and his CPA. Ms. Java Seed has a peppy, uplifting outlook on life and enjoys being a fitness instructor.</p>
